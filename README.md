This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked bug in PHP: unexpected type coercion of array keys. The `bug.php` file showcases the problematic code, highlighting how PHP's loose typing when handling array keys (specifically when dealing with functions that implicitly convert string keys to integers) can lead to unexpected behavior and errors. The solution, provided in `bugSolution.php`, uses stricter type handling to avoid such inconsistencies.
