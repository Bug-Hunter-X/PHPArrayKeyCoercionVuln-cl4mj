In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with array keys that are not strictly strings or integers.  PHP's loose typing can lead to unexpected behavior, especially when using functions that expect specific key types. For instance, consider using `array_keys()` to retrieve only integer keys from an array that also contains string keys.  If you expect an array of integers but instead get an array containing both integers and strings converted to integers, your logic may break unpredictably.

```php
$data = [1 => 'apple', '2' => 'banana', 3 => 'cherry'];
$keys = array_keys($data);
print_r($keys); //Output: Array ( [0] => 1 [1] => 2 [2] => 3 )
```

In this example, the string key '2' is implicitly treated as an integer key during the `array_keys()` operation, leading to unexpected results. This can also impact other array functions like `in_array()` which may compare values in a type-insensitive manner.
